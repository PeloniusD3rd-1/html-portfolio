<h1>Chris Hair's Favorite Movies</h1>

<hr />
<h2>These are my top 3 movies at the moment</h>
<hr />

<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>A few months ago we took a trip to Italy. Being able to go to Rome and see the Colosseum was really cool.<br />
My wife and I watched this movie and it made us feel like we were back in the days of the Romans</p>

<h3>Vacation</h3>
<p>This movie is the new movie National Lampoon Movie series. We like it because its funny and a bit crude.<br />
It's definitely another one we cannot watch with the kids until they are older.</p>

<h3>Nacho Libre</h3>
<p>This movie has been a favorite of mine since it first came out. I saw it in the theaters and continue to watch it all the time.
    I am hoping my kids will love it as it is an ageless classic for me.</p>
